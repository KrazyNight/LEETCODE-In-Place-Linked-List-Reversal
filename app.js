//Leetcode: 143. Reorder List 

/** Original Question
143. Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. 
Only nodes themselves may be changed.


Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]

//Leetcode: 25. Reverse Node in K-Group

/** Original Question
25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

- Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes 
of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

- k is a positive integer and is less than or equal
to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes
is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, 
only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
